Do the file(s) exist? If so, check if the file(s) are in your `.gitignore` or the global `pants_ignore` option, which may result in Pants not being able to see the file(s) even though they exist on disk. Refer to https://www.pantsbuild.org/v2.18/docs/troubleshooting#pants-cannot-find-a-file-in-your-project.
